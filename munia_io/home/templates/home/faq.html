								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How does this product compare to an Arduino?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content content-visible">Favorably. Benefits include not having to
									splice any cables,
									the device showing up as HID device on your computer, superior software, more stable
									firmware, ability
									to use the controller on our PC in e.g. emulators and better 3rd party controller
									support. In the end,
									though, both work and the MUNIA software also supports inputs from Arduino-based
									NintendoSpy devices!
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will you support console ‘X’?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Unless mentioned on the index page, the likely answer is no.
									The newer the console, the less likely it is we are able to tap into their signals.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Does it work with third-party controllers?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Many third-party controllers are known for being out of spec
									but the MUNIA devices make every effort to properly handle these. For Nintendo 64,
									Hori controllers are fully supported.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I already have an arduino setup. Can I still use the software?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Yes! The NintendoSpy/Arduino solution outputs the ones and zeroes on the
									controller line over a serial port to the PC. The MUNIA software can parse these packets
									and use them to animate SNES, N64 and Gamecube skins. This is not as powerful as the USB HID device
									as which the MUNIA presents itself.
								</div>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<ul id="software" class="cd-faq-group blank">
							<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>Software</h2></li>
							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you offer warranty on the devices?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Full 1-year carry-in warranty is provided for any hardware defects.
									If unforeseen incompatibilities are found I make every effort to add support for your setup,
									which after applying a firmware update might become supported. When in doubt whether
									your exotic setup will be supported, please contact me first.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">My capture card has some input delay. How do I synchronize the viewer?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">The software has a convenient input-lag compensation feature. It is able to store
									captured inputs and accurately delay them by any number of frames. This option is available from the
									<em>Options / Set lag compensation</em> menu.
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I customize the built-in skins?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Yes, in two ways. The software has a built-in
								</div>
							</li>

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I add a new skin?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">Skins are defined as SVG files with embedded attributes
									identifying varying parts of the controller. Any controller that identifies itself
									as a USB HID device can be supported with a custom skin. You can draw skins with
									vector graphics editing programs such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.
									A <a href="https://github.com/zzattack/munia/blob/master/SKINS.md">reference guide</a>
									for making skins compatible with your controller can be found on the Github project pages.

							<li>
								<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does ‘MUNIA’ mean?</a>
								<div class="cd-faq-content">The very first iteration of the device supported SNES, N64
									and NGC simultaneously. The acronym was for ‘Multi-use Nintendo Input Adapter’.
									Both the Multi-use and Nintendo parts no longer apply to most of our devices,
									so we’ve parted with the acronym but kept the pretty name.
